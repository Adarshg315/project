In this blog post, I'm going to discuss Linux Environment and a simple overview of it. Also, what career opportunities are there in the Industry for Linux.

ðŸ”´ What is Linux?

Linux is a group of free and open-source operating systems. Itâ€™s based on core software called the Linux Kernel. The Kernel is free and open-source, which means that anyone can use it to create their version of Linux. Linux is the best-known and most-used open-source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computerâ€™s hardware.

ðŸ”´ Why Choose Linux Over Windows

ðŸ”° Open Source
The main difference between Windows and Linux is the ladder is open-source software, whereas the code for Windows is highly secure. Since Linux is an open-source operating system, anyone with a desktop and internet access can download it, change it, and contribute to the internal Kernel.

ðŸ”° Free
Another major benefit of Linux is that itâ€™s free. Users wonâ€™t have to pay up to \$250 to get their hands on a copy of a Linux distro (such as Ubuntu, Fedora).

ðŸ”° Reliable
Linux is considered more reliable than Windows. Linux offers a top-notch interface, built-in security, and unmatched uptime. Its popular competitor, Windows, is known to be sluggish at times. Users need to re-install Windows after encountering crashes or slowdowns on your system. As a Linux user, you wonâ€™t have to worry about re-installing your system to experience a faster and smoother operation. Linux helps your system run smoothly for a more extended period.

ðŸ”° Secure
While no operating system is entirely risk-free, Windows is a frequent victim for developers of viruses and malware. Since thereâ€™s little that Microsoft can do about this issue, users must install an antivirus application and firewall software. Unfortunately, this eats into your memory and CPU usage.

Linux by nature is more secure than Windows. When you choose Linux as your operating system, you just need to stick to the repositories and avoid using Adobeâ€™s Flash.

ðŸ”° Privacy
With increased government monitoring and corporate collection of user data, privacy has been the number one concern for savvy internet users. Independent security experts favor Linux over Windows or MacOS. Since most Linux distributions donâ€™t collect your personal data, you can remain somewhat hidden from Big Brother.

ðŸ”´ Career options in Linux

The crucial areas include an understanding of partitioning, installation, providing services, troubleshooting networks, managing users, basic scripting, and operating system related problems. Getting a practical exposure in this domain is also quite easy as schools, colleges, and organizations often have requirements for candidates possessing this skillset. Getting an experience here will open a pathway for you to become an efficient Linux administrator.
